/* 6.21 (Separating Digits)Write methods that accomplish each of the
following tasks:

1. Calculate the integer part of the quotient when integer a is
divided by integer b.

2. Calculate the integer remainder when integer a is divided by
integer b.

3. Use the methods developed in parts (a) and (b) to write a method
displayDigits that receives an integer between 1 and
99999 and displays it as a sequence of digits, separating each
pair of digits by two spaces. For example, the integer 4562
should appear as
		4  5  6  2

Incorporate the methods into an application that inputs an integer
and calls displayDigits by passing the method the integer
entered. Display the results. */
