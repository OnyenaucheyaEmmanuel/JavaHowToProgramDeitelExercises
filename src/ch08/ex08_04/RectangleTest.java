and width, each of which defaults to 1. Provide methods that calculate
the rectangle’s perimeter and area. It has set and get methods for both
length and width. The set methods should verify that length and
width are each floating-point numbers larger than 0.0 and less than 20.0.
Write a program to test class Rectangle. */
