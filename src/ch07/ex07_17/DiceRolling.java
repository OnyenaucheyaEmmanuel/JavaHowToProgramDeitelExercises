/* 7.17 (Dice Rolling) Write an application to simulate the rolling of two
dice. The application should use an object of class Random once to roll
the first die and again to roll the second die. The sum of the two values
should then be calculated. Each die can show an integer value from 1 to 6,
so the sum of the values will vary from 2 to 12, with 7 being the most
frequent sum, and 2 and 12 the least frequent. Figure 7.28 shows the 36
possible combinations of the two dice. Your application should roll the
dice 36,000,000 times. Use a one-dimensional array to tally the number of
times each possible sum appears. Display the results in tabular format. */
