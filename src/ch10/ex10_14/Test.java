/* 10.14 (Project: Shape Hierarchy) Implement the Shape hierarchy
shown in Fig. 9.3 . Each TwoDimensionalShape should contain
method getArea to calculate the area of the two-dimensional shape.
Each ThreeDimensionalShape should have methods getArea and
getVolume to calculate the surface area and volume, respectively, of the
three-dimensional shape. Create a program that uses an array of Shape
references to objects of each concrete class in the hierarchy. The program
should print a text description of the object to which each array element
refers. Also, in the loop that processes all the shapes in the array,
determine whether each shape is a TwoDimensionalShape or a
ThreeDimensionalShape. If it’s a TwoDimensionalShape,
display its area. If it’s a ThreeDimensionalShape, display its area
and volume. */
