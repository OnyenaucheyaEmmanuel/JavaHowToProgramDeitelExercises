/* 17.21 (Calculating the Average of the Elements in a Two-Dimensional
Array) Figure 7.19 defined a two-dimensional array of grades with 10
rows and three columns, representing 10 students’ grades on three exams.
Use a stream pipeline to calculate the average of all the grades. For this
exercise, use Stream method of to create a stream from the two-dimensional
array and Stream method flatMapToInt to map each
row into a stream of int values. */
