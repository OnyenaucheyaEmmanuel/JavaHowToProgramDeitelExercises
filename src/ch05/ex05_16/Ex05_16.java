/* 5.16 (Bar-Chart Printing Program) One interesting application of
computers is to display graphs and bar charts. Write an application that
reads five numbers between 1 and 30. For each number that’s read, your
program should display the same number of adjacent asterisks. For
example, if your program reads the number 7, it should display *******.
Display the bars of asterisks after you read all five numbers. */
